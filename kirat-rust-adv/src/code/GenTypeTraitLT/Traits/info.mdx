# Traits

> Traits are just like interface in typescript class implementation. Like in a class we can have different methods. Now in interface we can actually say what kind of method/function we can have in that class and implement the interface inside the class.
> Traits can have the implementation of fn which can be impl inside struct. Now inside that struct we can only write those fn that are mentioned in the Traits. This gives the type safety just like in typescript or java in oop.
> We can also take struct impl a trait as parameter. Also we can declare return type of a function which impl a trait
