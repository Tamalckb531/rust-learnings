# Hashmap as a collection 

> Only thing to remind is the insert function can transfer the ownership to hashmap. So adding value in a variable before inserting, makes the variable invalid after the insert.

> Also there is an api called entry which can insert value on a key based on it exist or not and returns the reference of the value of that key for further operation.
