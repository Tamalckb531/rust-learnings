# Structs
 
 > Similar with the object of Javascript. 
 > Need the create struct xyz{ } like we creates types in typescript and then can declare the struct variable with the type. 
 > All the static data of struct data stored in the stack and String like dynamic data will store in heap. It works just like it should but now all the data are bind together in a single object/struct
