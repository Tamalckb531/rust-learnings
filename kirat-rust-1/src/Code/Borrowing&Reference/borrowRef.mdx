## Borrowing :

> We can borrow the address or data of a variable to another like we see in the ownerships. Like direct transfer can transfer the ownerships but by pointing to the address we can just borrow the memory reference of that variable to another 

## Rules of Borrowing :

> We can borrow one or multiple times without mutating the data. 
> We can borrow only once if we try to mutate the data.
