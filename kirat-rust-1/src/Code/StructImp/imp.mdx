# Implements

> It's like the class in cpp. Like in rust we don't have classes, so we can use the struct as class by implement functions on them which can use the variable declared in struct

> Syntax : first declare a Struct xyz \{ write variables inside }\ then declare the implements impl xyz \{ write functions inside } the xyz should be same name in both places
